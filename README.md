# IPEDS Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data using Python. The script processes and extracts meaningful insights from large datasets, providing valuable statistics about educational institutions. It utilizes libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy` to handle data processing efficiently.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Reads IPEDS data and processes it into a usable format.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values, formatting, and type conversions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs various statistical operations on the dataset, such as averages, totals, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates visual representations of the data, showcasing trends and comparisons between different institutions.

## Project Structure
- **`ipeds_main_2.py`**: The main Python script that processes and analyzes the IPEDS data.
